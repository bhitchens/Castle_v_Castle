Run the server.py file on a linux server. Include IP addresses of game systems as arguments.

Run nix_client on linux game machines and win_client on windows game machines. Change URL to that of the server.

The server requires ssl certificates to encrypt traffic. These can be generated by running:
openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.cert
